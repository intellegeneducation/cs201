Intellgen Education was founded in 2019 in Orange County, California, by David Dai 
and Eric Yin, who want their kids to enjoy coding and STEM program. As software 
engineers, they believe that strong logical thinking can be helpful for kids' 
STEM program. With that in mind, they created a series of courses for their kids. 
Through weekly learning and practice, their kids were 
able to enjoy coding and started to apply logical thinking in programming projects.
